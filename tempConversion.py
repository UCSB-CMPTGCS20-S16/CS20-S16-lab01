# tempConversion.py   A module for converting between fahrenheit and celsius

# The following starting point code passes some test cases, 
# but it fails others.  Your job in this lab exercise is to modify the code
# so that is passes all of the test cases

  return ctemp + 32.0   # TODO: Fix this line of code
